# About me:
### Hi there! üëã  

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong foundation in Mathematics. My journey started with a Bachelor's in Mathematics, and during my final year, I discovered the deep connection between math and Machine Learning that's when I knew ML was my calling.

I love exploring mathematical theories behind algorithms and transforming them into practical, impactful solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between math and machine learning, building models that solve real-world problems.
